## Abstract

HTTP/3 is the third and upcoming major version of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol
used to exchange information on the World Wide Web, alongside HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.

This proposal is for how the gRPC protocol should run on top of the HTTP/3 protocol.

## Background

gRPC uses HTTP semantics but requires HTTP/2 for some features. HTTP/3 offers the
same capabilities as HTTP/2, enabling all gRPC scenarios, along with new benefits
offered by HTTP/3:

* Faster connection negotiation in fewer round-trips.
* Improved experience when there is connection packet loss.
* Client supports transitioning between networks.

[PROTOCOL-HTTP2.md](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/PROTOCOL-HTTP2.md) covers gRPC's HTTP semantics, along with some content
that is specific to HTTP/2. Either this document should be generalized to include
HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 information, or a new gRPC over HTTP/3 protocol document should
be created.

## Proposal

### HTTP semantics

The shape of a gRPC HTTP requests and responses are unchanged in HTTP/3. The
content in [PROTOCOL-HTTP2.md](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/PROTOCOL-HTTP2.md) that covers requests and responses can be referred
to directly, without any duplication.

Notably, unlike gRPC-Web, the content-type of `application/grpc` is unchanged.

### Transport mapping

The gRPC over HTTP/2 specification [discusses HTTP2 transport mapping](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/PROTOCOL-HTTP2.md#http2-transport-mapping). The content discussed is mostly applicable to HTTP/3.

#### Stream Identification

HTTP/3 stream IDs function largely the same as HTTP/2 stream IDs.

#### Data frames

The relationship between `DATA` frames and length prefixed messages are unchanged in HTTP/3.

#### Errors

HTTP/3 [has different error codes](https://quicwg.org/base-drafts/draft-ietf-quic-http.html#section-8.1) from HTTP/2. HTTP/3 errors are sent via QUIC frames instead of an `RST_STREAM` HTTP frame.

HTTP/3 errors are used in three situations:

* Abruptly terminating streams
* Aborting reading of streams
* Immediately closing HTTP/3 connections

HTTP3 Code|HTTP2 Code|GRPC Code
----------|----------|-----------
H3_NO_ERROR(0x0100)|NO_ERROR(0)|INTERNAL - An explicit GRPC status of OK should have been sent but this might be used to aggressively [lameduck](https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/load-balancing-datacenter/#identifying-bad-tasks-flow-control-and-lame-ducks-bEs0uy) in some scenarios.
H3_GENERAL_PROTOCOL_ERROR(0x0101)|PROTOCOL_ERROR(1)|INTERNAL
H3_INTERNAL_ERROR(0x0102)|INTERNAL_ERROR(2)|INTERNAL
H3_STREAM_CREATION_ERROR(0x0103)|n/a|INTERNAL
H3_CLOSED_CRITICAL_STREAM(0x0104)|n/a|INTERNAL
H3_FRAME_UNEXPECTED(0x0105)|FRAME_SIZE_ERROR|INTERNAL
H3_FRAME_ERROR(0x0106)|FRAME_SIZE_ERROR|INTERNAL
H3_EXCESSIVE_LOAD(0x0107)|ENHANCE_YOUR_CALM|RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED ...with additional error detail provided by runtime to indicate that the exhausted resource is bandwidth.
H3_ID_ERROR(0x0108)|n/a|INTERNAL
H3_SETTINGS_ERROR(0x0109)|SETTINGS_TIMEOUT(4)|INTERNAL
H3_MISSING_SETTINGS(0x010a)|SETTINGS_TIMEOUT(4)|INTERNAL
H3_REQUEST_REJECTED(0x010b)|REFUSED_STREAM|UNAVAILABLE - Indicates that no processing occurred and the request can be retried, possibly elsewhere.
H3_REQUEST_CANCELLED(0x010c)|CANCEL(8)|Mapped to call cancellation when sent by a client.Mapped to CANCELLED when sent by a server. Note that servers should only use this mechanism when they need to cancel a call but the payload byte sequence is incomplete.
H3_REQUEST_INCOMPLETE(0x010d)|n/a|INTERNAL
H3_MESSAGE_ERROR(0x010e)|n/a|INTERNAL
H3_CONNECT_ERROR(0x010f)|CONNECT_ERROR|INTERNAL
H3_VERSION_FALLBACK(0x0110)|n/a|INTERNAL
n/a|FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR(3)|INTERNAL
n/a|STREAM_CLOSED|No mapping as there is no open stream to propagate to. Implementations should log.
n/a|COMPRESSION_ERROR|INTERNAL
n/a|INADEQUATE_SECURITY| PERMISSION_DENIED â€¦ with additional detail indicating that permission was denied as protocol is not secure enough for call.

#### Connection management

`GOAWAY` and `PING` frames exist in HTTP/3 and serve the same purpose as in HTTP/2.
One notable difference is the `GOAWAY` frame in HTTP/2 reports the last
successfully processed stream ID. In HTTP/3 the `GOAWAY` frame ID value must be greater
that the last successfully processed stream ID.

### Exceeding deadlines

When an RPC has exceeded its deadline in HTTP/2, the server will complete the response
with a gRPC status code of DEADLINE_EXCEEDED, then send a `RST_STREAM` frame to the
client to stop it from continuing to send the request stream. The client gets the
response and reports the DEADLINE_EXCEEDED failure to the app.

The `RST_STREAM` frame doesn't exist in HTTP/3. QUIC supports stopping the reading and sending parts of a QUIC
stream independently. Two QUIC frames have replaced `RST_STREAM` functionality:

* [RESET_STREAM](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000.html#name-reset_stream-frames) - Abruptly terminate the sending part of a stream.
* [STOP_SENDING](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000.html#name-stop_sending-frames) - Requests that a peer cease transmission on a stream.

`RESET_STREAM` is not appropriate because the response with the DEADLINE_EXCEEDED status
code should reach the client. Because QUIC frames can be received out-of-order,
sending this QUIC frame after completing the response can cause the client
to abort the request.

`STOP_SENDING` should be sent to the client by a gRPC server after it completes the response.
It accurately communicates to the client that it should stop sending RPC messages.
The application error code should be H3_NO_ERROR(0x0100).

## Rationale

HTTP/3 is a [highly requested feature](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/19126) for gRPC.

HTTP/3's benefits include:

* Faster connection negotiation in fewer round-trips.
* Improved experience when there is connection packet loss.
* Client supports transitioning between networks.

HTTP/3 is completing standardization. Usage of HTTP/3 across the internet
and between applications will grow and gRPC should have a specification for
running on it.

## Implementation

A trial implementation in grpc-dotnet is underway. .NET 6 is adding preview support for
HTTP/3 to the .NET server and client. grpc-dotnet leverages that underlying HTTP/3 support.
